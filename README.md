N64 Controller
==============

This project aims to upgrade the N64 controller. This involves designing a new PCB that fits into the original N64 Controller housing. Upgrades include:
  - The awful N64 joystick module will be replaced with a modern stick harvested from a Logitech controller. I am so done with not being able to pivot utilt in smash 64 reliably because my thumb keeps slipping off of this shitty joystick
  - Compatible with USB as well as with the original N64 hardware. This allows playing at tournaments on the N64 while also playing at home on an emulator without having to use an additional adapter.
  - Rumble Pak is built in (I'm stealing the motors from another gamepad)
  - Controller Pak is built in (32 KiB of EEPROM can be written to/read from by the N64)
  - Joystick calibration and customization at a hardware level. In particular: Centering, deadzone & range adjustment, symmetry correction, and custom curves to adjust sensitivity in function of stick displacement
  - Macros
  - LEDs
  - Possibly some extra buttons
  - I thought about bluetooth support but I don't want to deal with batteries
